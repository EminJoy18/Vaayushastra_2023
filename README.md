# Vaayushastra_2023
This repository is maintained to preserve the works of mine during my term as a junior in Team Vaayushtra.
Team Vaayushatra is an aero-modelling club based out of Fr.Conceicao Rodrigues College Of Engineering.
During my term, I have - 
1. Made a Graphical User Interface for real-time reflection of the telemetry data communicated via sensors.
2. I have programmed the sensors using Arduino IDE for communicating the real-time flight data.
3. And, have also been a presenter of the model for the year 2023.

We have been ranked 11th globally in the SAE International Competition, overall,
And, 11th for the presentation.
